@dataclass
class GlobalRetryStatistics:
    """Per-process statistics aggregator for S3 retry operations.

    Aggregates statistics across all threads within this process (e.g., a DataLoader worker).
    Each process maintains its own independent statistics - no cross-process communication.
    In distributed training with DataLoader workers:
    - Each rank's main process has its own _global_retry_stats instance
    - Each DataLoader worker process (spawned via multiprocessing) has its own instance
    - Statistics are isolated per-process, ensuring accurate tracking without interference

    Uses WeakSet to track active instances - automatically handles cleanup
    even if threads die or exceptions occur during construction.

    Tracks both per-thread and cumulative statistics:
    - registered_threads: Per-thread counters (including PID and thread ID) for detailed breakdown
    - cumulative_*: Process-local cumulative counters (never reset, for atexit log)

    Statistics terminology:
    - operations_started: Number of S3 operations initiated (read/get_length/get_stream calls)
    - failed_operations: Operations that failed at least once and required retry
    - total_attempts: Sum of all attempts (initial + retries)

    Note: operations_started counts how many operations we started (each gets 1 initial attempt).
          total_attempts >= operations_started because failed operations retry multiple times.

    Thread safety:
    - Per-thread counters are lock-free (threading.local() ensures isolation)
    - Cumulative counters use a lock because += is not atomic in Python
    - Lock overhead is negligible (< 0.1% from benchmarks)
    - Single-threaded case: Lock acquisition is uncontended (instant, no blocking)
    - Multi-threaded case: Lock contention is minimal (only during retries, which are rare)

        bottleneck the entire training step, observed as `dataloading spikes` in the training charts.
